# Doctor's Clinic
In my project environment, I have Tomcat 9.0 as your local server, Oracle as the database, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface, JSP as the programming language, all managed within Eclipse Enterprise Edition. 
I have used JDBC for database connectivity, and user interface can be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create engaging web pages. Eclipse EE is your coding environment of choice. This project is a web-based booking system for an existing clinic, aiming to deliver the Doctor's Clinic application to the Android platform. 
It serves as a beta version of the Hospital Management System, offering enhanced flexibility for patients to book appointments directly with their chosen doctors through an electronic clinic's portal, thereby streamlining the pre-registration process and improving healthcare accessibility.
